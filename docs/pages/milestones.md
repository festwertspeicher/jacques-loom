## 1. Planning and Getting Started

### Goals of this Project Phase

* Have an overview of the project by setting up milestones, writing down (SMART) goals for each milestone, creating a Gantt diagram for the project and writing down what's not included by 18.06.2022.
* Have a good basis for starting the documentation and writing about the project by setting up a Website covering basic information by 15.06.2022.
* Gain knowledge, suggestions, support, through networking and starting conversations with peoples and institutions to further improve the quality and make the project known to local influencers in this field until 30.06.2022
* Get financial support and extend the supportive network from applying to Prototype Fund Hardware on 15.06.2022.
* Have my supervisors up to date with the development of the project by meeting them until 30.06.2022.

### Tasks of this Project Phase

- [x] Become member of a makerspace and workplace set up
- [x] Define the main goal and explain why it's the main goal more detailed 
- [ ] Define what is part of this project (and thesis) and what parts I won't cover for now.
E.g.: I won't make assembly guides for people to follow along for my thesis, because I want to cover different aspects of this project but instruction manuals will be an important part of this project later. *(1d)*
- [ ] Write an Article on the basic principles of a (Jacquard) loom including a glossary for readers to learn the lingo. Describe how my heddle selection mechanism should differ from existing machines. *(2d)*
- [x] Research and make a "Market analysis" - What is already on the market, what was done before. Why was it done that way, what are the Pros and Cons?
- [x] Create a Github Project, add Jekyll Website for Documentation
- [x] Create minimalistic branding (define Name, Logo, colors) and build Jekyll Theme
- [x] Have a short introduction of myself on the website. Show the way I work with some former projects. *(0.5d)*
- [x] Create a (private) Link List with collected informations
- [ ] Create a timetable for the project phases *(0.5d)*
- [x] Define Goals / SMART Goals for every Milestone
- [ ] Read and use the project planning book. *(0.5d)*
- [X] Define Questions and interview Andreas Moeller (Loom Maker and Inventor) *(1d)*
- [ ] Show my progress to Aram Bartholl und Peter Kabel *(0.5d)*
- [ ] Talk about my project with Studio Hilo *(0.25d)*
- [ ] Talk about my project with House of All / Fab City Hamburg *(0.5d)*
- [x] Talk about my project with Sabine (photo and video documentation)
- [ ] Visit the Tuchmachermuseum in Neum√ºnster *(1d)*
- [x] Apply for Prototype Fund Hardware

## 2. Invent Serial Warp Thread Selection Mechanism

### Goals of this Project Phase

* Invent a serial warp thread selection mechanism by building a modular teststand with a linear actor and testing at least three different mechanisms on it. The desired mechanism should fulfill the desired specs of my loom (reliability, tissue density, speed).
* Make sure the mechanism doesn't infringe a patent of by having it checked by a lawyer
* Ensure that the mechanism cannot be patented by a company by making it publicly available and choosing the right Open Hardware License for my project by consulting a lawyer
* Documenting the process by writing about the tested mechanisms and what specs they achieved.

### Tasks of this Project Phase

- [X] Build a linear actor teststand with a modular design to attach a variety of different mechanisms to it *(improvements 0.5d)*
- [X] Build a controllable pressurized air distribution unit
- [ ] Build and test at least three mechanisms: do they work? what needs to be improved, what could be problems with the mechanism? Can they reach the set goals? *(15d)*
- [ ] Build a simple software to test the mechanism *(2d)*
- [ ] Getting my supervisors on board with the development of the project *(0.5d)*
- [ ] Get a lawyer for checking patent infringement *(0.25d)*
- [ ] getting a consultation on choosing the right Open Hardware license. *(0.25d)*
- [ ] Document the process continuously *(5d)*

*total 188h*

## 3a. Create a Prototype

### Goals of this Project Phase

* Weave first fabrics by building a prototype loom with the found mechanism and running a minimal but sufficient software to uploaded images
* I want to learn how to design the other components of the loom by building a fast prototype. What works, what doesn't work?

### Tasks of this Project Phase
- [ ] Source materials *(0.5d)*
- [ ] Iterative: Design a loom with the found mechanism in CAD software *(14d)*
- [ ] Iterative: Build the loom. What needs to be improved? *(4d)*
- [ ] Write very simple but robust and sufficient software, including a (web) GUI, Software for the microcontroller, basic communication protocol and image upload *(6d)*
- [ ] Documentation of the Process *(8d)*

*total 280h*

## 3b. Interim Report

### Goals of this Project Phase

* Hand in a printed report about this project as my MA thesis by combining good photos/videos of the loom and with documentation of the process from this website in a layouted and lectured form that [match the regulations of my university](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/fileadmin/DMI-D/PDF/Abschlussarbeiten/Thesis_Richtlinien_BA_MA_210706.pdf)

### Tasks of this Project Phase

- [ ] Taking photos *(0.5d)*
- [ ] editing of the photos *(1d)*
- [ ] Filming a video *(1d)*
- [ ] Cutting and editing the video *(3d)*
- [ ] Extract all texts from the website and use a markdown importer for inDesign *(0.5d)*
- [ ] Proof read all texts from the website *(1d)* 
- [ ] Fill the logical gaps. Is there content missing and where? Is everything up to date? *(4d)*
- [ ] Spell check the text
- [ ] Make a Layout of the content in inDesign *(3d)*
- [ ] Get the documentation printed and bound *(0.5d)*
- [ ] Hand the report in, send copies to important people and institutions *(1d)*
- [ ] celebrate and take a day off

*total 124h*

## 4. Major Version of the Loom (288 hours).

### Goals of this Project Phase

* Design and build the first reliable major version of the loom by combining the learnings from the previous phases and starting from scratch with a new parametric CAD model.
* Arouse interest by having nice promo photos/videos of the loom.
* The loom should be easy to recreate by making CAD files, schematics, BOM available alongside detailed and illustrated step-by-step building instructions.
* The loom should be easy to operate by having articles on how to use the machine and running a more robust and failsafe software with a decent user interface.

### Tasks of this Project Phase
- [ ] new parametric and clean CAD Design *(10d)*
- [ ] Build and test the loom *(5d)*
- [ ] Take promo photos and videos of the finished loom *(2d)*
- [ ] editing of the promo photos *(1d)*
- [ ] cutting and editing the promo video *(4d)*
- [ ] creating a new software version with a decent communication protocol and advanced GUI *(6d)*
- [ ] update website, move all outdated buildlog stuff to an archive page *(1d)*
- [ ] Make a nice package with CAD Files, Schematics and BOM and Code available *(1d)*
- [ ] Disassemble and reassemble the loom. Taking videos / photos of the assembly *(1d)*
- [ ] editing of the assembly photos *(1d)*
- [ ] cutting and editing the assembly video *(3d)*
