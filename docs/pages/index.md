# The ‘Jacques’ Project

Goal of this project is the development of a computerized open hardware Jacquard loom prototype called ‘Jacques’. This Type of Loom can create complex patterning of woven fabrics by selectively raising or lowering every single heddle (and warp thread) automatically.

Jacquard Weaving is a large scale production method highly inaccessible for designers or non-professional users in need of small quantities. There is nearly no possibility of a local small scale manufacturing of woven Jacquard Fabrics.

Tackling this problem I want to find a new warp selection mechanism that is significantly cheaper and smaller to build than the current industry standards but makes sacrifices in speed and tissue density as a trade off.

The Project will be an Open Hardware Project - comprehensible, for other people to rebuild and improve with a transparent development phase through a build log on this Website. Thereby I try to explain and illuminate my (design) decisions on this special regards.

This is my practical project to get my MA degree at the Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften Hamburg.

## Milestones

### 1. Planing and Getting Started

#### Goals of this Project Phase

* Have an overview of the project and whats not included / the limitations written down.
* Gaining an overview of the projects' timeframe. Develop a timetable for each milestone.
* Formulated (SMART) goals for setting the projects requirements, specs and limitations
* Having a good basis for starting the documentation and writing about the project
* Having a Website covering basic informations, timetables and goals about the project for starting a conversation with peoples and institutions
* Gaining knowledge, suggestions, support, through networking
* Potentially gaining financial support and supportive network from applying to Prototype Fund Hardware
* Getting my supervisors on board with the development of the project

#### Tasks of this Project Phase

- [ ] Defining the main goal and explain why it's the main goal more detailed
- [ ] Defining what is part of this project (or thesis) and what parts I won't cover for now.
E.g.: I won't make assembly guides for people to follow along now, because I want to cover different aspects of this project for my thesis but instructables will be an important part of this project in the future.
- [ ] Write an Article on the basic principles of a (Jacquard) loom including a glossary for readers to learn the lingo. Describe how my heddle selection mechanism should differ from existing machines.
- [ ] "Market analysis" - What is already on the market, what was done before. Why was it done that way, what are the Pros and Cons?
- [x] Create a Github Project, add Jekyll Website for Documentation
- [x] Create minimalistic branding (define Name, Logo, colors) and build Jekyll Theme
- [ ] Have a short introduction of myself on the website. Show the way I work with some former projects.
- [ ] Create a (private) Link List with collected informations
- [ ] Create a timetable for the project phases
- [ ] Define Goals / SMART Goals for every Milestone, Subpoint
- [ ] Read and use the Project Planing Book.
- [ ] Define Questions and interview Alex Moeller (Loom Maker and Inventor)
- [ ] Show my progress to Aram Bartholl und Peter Kabel
- [ ] Talk about my project with Studio Hilo
- [ ] Talk about my project with House of All / Fab City Hamburg
- [ ] Talk about my project with Sabine Müller (photo and video documentation)
- [ ] Apply for Prototype Fund Hardware (last chance for application 15.06.22)

### 2. Weave Adapter for a Knitting Machine

#### Goals of this Project Phase

* Getting a Proof of Concept: Can a loom work with a serial selection mechanism as used in a knitting machine? What works and what does not work? Is the shed wide enough? What needs to be improved?
* Knowing what functional assemblies a loom need
* Learning how to produce the custom parts with a laser cutter. How to make them fit perfectly and how to make laser cut joints.
* Having a first MVP product that i can show for demonstration of the serial selection principle for weaving textiles.
* Documentation of the Process

#### Tasks of this Project Phase

- [x] get a knitting machine (Brother KH9xx)
- [ ] clean it and function test it
- [ ] build a small table for it
- [ ] convert the machines' card reader to a modern digital controll unit using [AYAB](https://ayab-knitting.com/)
- [ ] Add 3d printed Cover to fit the new electronic
- [ ] Design the Loom around the knitting machine
- [ ] optional for now: Refinement of the final design and publishing CAD and DXF files for laser cutting.
- [ ] optional for now: Write build/assembly instructions
- [ ] Getting my supervisors on board with the development of the project
- [ ] Document the process continously

### 3. Invent Serial Heddle Selection Mechanism

#### Goals of this Project Phase

* Build a teststand with a linear actor and find a mechansim that fulfills the SMART goals of my loom (reliability, tissue density, speed)
* Develop an understandment what functional assemblies the heddle selection mechanism needs
* Have the mechanism checked by a lawyer for patent law to not violate copyright of a company
* Documentation of the Process

#### Tasks of this Project Phase

- [ ] build a linear actor teststand with a modular design to attach a variety of different mechanisms to it
- [ ] build a controllable pressurised air distribution unit
- [ ] test at least three mechanisms: do they work? can they reach the setted SMART goals?
- [ ] Getting my supervisors on board with the development of the project
- [ ] Document the process continously

### 4. Create a Prototype

#### Goals of this Project Phase

* Combine the findings of the previous project phases and build a reliable prototype loom that can weave with the found and tested mechanism
* Have nice photos and videos of the Loom, Documentation of the Process

#### Tasks of this Project Phase
- [ ] iterative: CAD design
- [ ] iterative prototype build
- [ ] writing documentation
- [ ] making pictures, videos and editing

### 5. Interim Report

#### Goals of this Project Phase

* Hand in printed interim report as my MA thesis.
* The report should include all the lectured documentation from this website and additional content covering my process and thoughts of this project
* It should be well designed, and includes good photos of the project.
* It should match the regulations of my MA Thesis

#### Tasks of this Project Phase

- [ ] Extrakt all texts form the website
- [ ] Proof read all texts from the website 
- [ ] Is there content missing and where? Fill the logical gaps
- [ ] Getting the text lectured
- [ ] Make a Layout of the content in inDesign
- [ ] Get the documentation printed and get the book bound
- [ ] hand it in, send copies to important people and institutions.


### 6. Outlook: Building a Wire Bending Machine
### 7. Outlook: Create the next Iteration Final Machine
