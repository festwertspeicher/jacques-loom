## About the â€˜Jacquesâ€™ Project

Goal of this project is the development of a computerized Jacquard loom prototype called â€˜Jacquesâ€™.

Jacquard weaving is a large-scale production method highly inaccessible for designers or non-professional users in need of small quantities. Textiles or woven fabrics are mainly imported in large batches and come along with a long and intransparent supply chain including [environmental](https://earth.org/fast-fashions-detrimental-effect-on-the-environment/) and political issues such as [violations of international human rights](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html) and ultimately [disposal issues](https://www.textilemountainfilm.com/about). There is nearly no possibility of a decentralized local small scale manufacturing of woven Jacquard fabrics.

To make Jacquard weaving more accessible and tackle the mentioned problems I want to design an inexpensive and small Open Hardware Jacquard loom for private and small scale usage. A new warp selection mechanism will make the loom significantly cheaper and smaller to build than the current industry standards but makes sacrifices in speed and tissue density as a trade off.

The Project will be an Open Hardware Project - comprehensible, for other people to rebuild and improve with a transparent development phase through a build log on this Website. Thereby I try to explain and illuminate my (design) decisions on this special regard. The CAD files, Gerber files and schematics, bill of materials, software code and a detailed assembly instructions will be available to the public for people to build their own loom. The ultimate goal is a fully functional machine that goes beyond a proof of concept status and serves as a real production tool.

The interims report and the first prototypes will be my practical project to get my MA degree at the Hochschule fÃ¼r angewandte Wissenschaften Hamburg.

## About me


Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Norman and I'm an industrial designer and maker. I am a master student at the University of Applied Sciences Hamburg (Department Design). Prior to the development of this loom, I worked at the german electron synchrotron [DESY](https://www.desy.de/) at a project for [early childhood STEM education](https://www.haus-der-kleinen-forscher.de/de/fortbildungen/paedagogik), on various [websites](https://alpha-alpaka.de/) and user interfaces, a large format 3D printer with tool changer, the multimedia installation ['Confessional3000'](https://www.feinschwarz.net/beichtstuhl3000-eine-kunstinstallation-auf-dem-reeperbahnfestival/) and furniture systems for highly flexible working environments ([SCOPE](https://designforhumannature.de/scope/) & [FRAMEWORKER](https://designforhumannature.de/frameworker/)).
