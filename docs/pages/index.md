## About the ‘Jacques’ Project

Goal of this project is the development of a computerized Jacquard loom prototype called ‘Jacques’.

Jacquard weaving is a large scale production method highly inaccessible for designers or non-professional users in need of small quantities. Textiles or woven fabrics are mainly imported in large batches and coming along with a long and intransparent supply chain including [environmental](https://earth.org/fast-fashions-detrimental-effect-on-the-environment/) and political issues such as [violations of international human rights](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html) and fullcircle [disposial issues](https://www.textilemountainfilm.com/about). There is nearly no possibility of a decentralized local small scale manufacturing of woven Jacquard fabrics.

For making Jacquard weaving more accessible and tackle the mentioned problems I want to design an inexpensive and small Open Hardware Jacquard loom for private and small scale usage. A new warp selection mechanism will make the loom significantly cheaper and smaller to build than the current industry standards but makes sacrifices in speed and tissue density as a trade off.

The Project will be an Open Hardware Project - comprehensible, for other people to rebuild and improve with a transparent development phase through a build log on this Website. Thereby I try to explain and illuminate my (design) decisions on this special regards. The end goal are open-sourced licenced CAD files, Gerber files if needed and schematics, bill of materials, software code and a detailled assembly instruction for people to build their own loom.

The interims report and the first prototypes will be my practical project to get my MA degree at the Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften Hamburg.
