This is a non commercial open source project. I spend a lot of time refining the idea of the project and will spend a lot of time bringing it to life, and to make it accessible. One way to get funding for a project like this is the Prototype Fund Hardware in Germany. The Prototype Fund Hardware is a project of the [Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland](https://okfn.de/), funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research ("[Bundesministerium f√ºr Bildung und Forschung](https://www.bmbf.de/)") within the context of [WIR](https://www.innovation-strukturwandel.de/strukturwandel/de/innovation-strukturwandel/_documents/artikel/kontakt.html?nn=452028) and the project [WI+R](https://digitale-reparaturfabrik.de/). The answers to the questions asked in the application form provides a good insight on what I'm planing to do in the next months. So I thought this might be a good first post to get you in the project.
